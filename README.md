## Course Material

This course is intended to provide an introduction to the research and practice of data visualization.

In the first half of the semester, we will study the theory underlying visualization, including an understanding of human perception and types of data.
We will also be covering the basics of the Git version control system, the GitHub ecosystem, and web programming, as well as growing comfortable working with the D3.js visualization library.
We will continue our discussion of theory looking at the process of design as it relates to visualization, including learning the Five Design-Sheet method that we will use throughout the semester.
We will conclude our theory component studying at the importance of interaction in visualization systems.

In the second half of the semester, we will apply our theoretical understanding in two ways: through design and critique.
We will practice designing visualizations for various data types, including tabular data, tree data, graph data, text data, and geographic data.
We will look at systems and tools that have been built for visualizing data and you will gain experience working with one of the most popular systems (Tableau) directly.
You will also give a short talk on an award-winning visualization project, including highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the project with respect to the theory you have learned.

Finally, throughout the course you will be designing and implementing a full-fledged visualization of a dataset as part of a team, using the knowledge and skills developed throughout the course.






## Learning Objectives

At the conclusion of this course, you will be expected to be able to:
* Recognize different types of data
* Design effective visualizations of data based on its data type and the intended tasks
* Critique and improve visualizations
* Understand the human perception system and how that informs data visualization
* Comprehend both foundational and cutting edge visualization research 
* Program in Javascript and understand the basic components of HTML and CSS
* Utilize the D3.js visualization library
* Describe the relative merits of various visualization tools and systems
* Build dashboards using the Tableau visualization system
* Give a presentation in the Ignite Talk format
* Use the Git version control system to manage a project codebase
* Work effectively as a member of a small design and development team


## Textbook

One textbook is required for this course:

> Visualization Analysis & Design by Tamara Munzner

There will be additional articles, resources, and videos available through Moodle.


## Reading

Readings will come from both the textbook as well as from the visualization research literature.
Please read carefully. You are responsible for all material in all readings.
While I will be highlighting portions as well as adding additional material and context, I will not cover everything from the readings in class.
It may help to take notes on the readings for reference later and in class.


## Engaged Participation

Throughout the course there will be numerous days in class with small or large group activities.
These include design exercises, critiques, and discussions.
You are expected to actively participate in all of these activities and to be respectful to your classmates, me, and any guests.


## Homeworks

There are seven homework assignments throughout the semester and descriptions of each will be posted on Moodle.
These assignments range from learning visualization programming APIs and systems to reading and summarizing the cutting edge in visualization research.
Homeworks are to be completed individually.
As many of the homeworks are foundational, it is not appropriate (and is an Honor Code violation) to simply search for solutions online.
Instead, the appropriate online resources will be posted along with the description and grading criteria of each assignment on Moodle.

Coding-based homeworks will be distributed through GitHub.

Unless otherwise specified, homeworks are due at the start of class on the day that they are assigned and late homeworks will be penalized 10% for each 24 past the due date and time. (E.g., an assignment due at 2:30pm Thursday turned in from 2:31 Thursday-2:29pm Friday would be penalized 10%, turned in 2:30pm Friday-2:29pm Saturday 20%, etc.)

## Ignite Talks

Ignite Talks are presentations in a very specific format: 20 slides, 15 seconds each (auto-advancing).
This format has become quite popular in the tech "meet-up" community as well as at tech industry conferences.
The format encourages fast, engaging, and visually interesting presentations. The talks usually have minimal slides with large amounts of text due to the rapid pace of slide changes.

You will give one Ignite Talk in the middle of semester on a winner of the 2016 Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards, the top award for visualization design. You will need to sign up in advance for a presentation slot on Moodle. More details, including grading criteria, will be posted on Moodle.

## Project

In order to have experience developing a visualization system, you will participate in a team of three to design and build a visualization of a real-world dataset.
The project will consist of seven milestones. Descriptions of the milestones will be available on Moodle along with deadlines, grading criteria, Honor Code policy, and breakdown of the value of each milestone towards your project grade. Note that unlike homeworks, __a late project milestone will result in a grade of 0 for that milestone__.

In other offerings of this course at other institutions, finding a good dataset has proven to be both more difficult than students expect and not finding a good dataset more detrimental to the overall project than students expect.
Therefore, while you are encouraged to suggest datasets, the final datasets for the projects will be chosen by me.

This is a semester-long project, and the grading expectations will reflect that. No milestone is a "leave to the last night" assignment.




## Exams

There is one midterm exam (tentatively scheduled for Tuesday October 17) and a final exam (Friday December 15 from 1:30pm-4:30pm as assigned by the registrar), all pledged. Make­-up exams may be oral, and will be given only for appropriately documented reasons of illness, family emergency, religious obligation, or participation in a university­-sponsored event. If you know you will be absent for a valid reason on an exam date, you must inform me as soon as possible so that we can arrange an alternate time for you to take the exam, preferably in advance of the rest of the class.




## Honor Code

By signing/typing the Honor Pledge, you assert that you have followed the applicable collaboration policies, understand all material (code and/or text) submitted, and __are capable of recreating it without assistance__  (even if the assignment allowed you to get help from other students). The point of group assignments is for you to learn from each other, NOT for you to split up the work to do in isolation... work together. For some assignments, you will be allowed to use the internet to search for helpful information (the assignment will specify what you can search for). Whenever you do this, __you MUST provide the URLs of every site referenced, with an explanation of how the site helped you__. Failure to do so is a violation of the Honor Code.

In general, unless otherwise specified, it is a violation of the Honor Code to obtain code from others (at SU or otherwise).
<!-- , or to consult materials from previous offerings of this course. -->
You are never allowed, for any assignment, to get help from other students outside of this class. For all assignments, you must have written or typed the submission, and you must personally understand each submission well enough that you could recreate it on your own.
<!-- If a student is repeating the course, it is expected that he/she recreate solutions to all graded assignments from scratch. -->







## Attendance

Class attendance is expected and required. You are responsible for making up all missed in-class material. I encourage you to acquire contact information from your classmates as soon as possible. Missing more than ten percent of a given class (arriving late, leaving early, sleeping, or otherwise inattentive in class) may be considered an absence.


For __each__ absence, you are expected to do the following:
1. Send me an email at least 1 hour before the start of class stating that you will be absent for that particular class. You do not need to tell me why; you simply need to inform me in advance. However, if you believe the absence is excused under university policy, you must also provide me with sufficient information to determine that. Even if you mention a future absence to me in person, you must still send me an email with details about your absence.
1. Show me a copy of your notes from the missed day at the start of the next class.
1. Complete the activities for the missed day by the next class period or a pre-arranged date for excused absences.

Provided you successfully complete #1, #2, and #3 the absence will have no direct impact on your grade. Completing only #1, but not #2 or #3, will result in a zero for that day's activity grade but no further penalty. Failing to complete #1 will result in one percentage point being deducted for the absence from your final grade.


Note that this policy applies to all absences, even those deemed excused under university policy (e.g. university­-sponsored activities, absences due to religious and cultural traditions). The Excused Absence Policy requires students to notify the professor as far in advance as possible, and to complete missed work. Though university policy does not consider illness to be an excused absence, I encourage you to use your best judgment in such situations, particularly if you may be contagious. Extenuating circumstances that prevent you from contacting me in advance will be handled on a case­-by-­case basis.

If you have five or more unexcused absences (whether or not you have followed the procedures above), you may be involuntarily withdrawn from the course.





## Grading

Your final grade will be computed as follows.

Component |	Weight
---------|---------
Engaged Participation	|  5%
Homeworks |	25%
Project | 30%
Midterm and Final Exams	| 40%


The grade cutoffs are listed here.

Grade | Min. Score
------|----------
A | 93%
A- |	90%
B+ |	87%
B	| 83%
B- |	80%
C+ |	77%
C	| 73%
C- |	70%
D	| 65%
D-	| 60%

They may be modified slightly at the instructor’s discretion, but only in your favor. In truly exceptional cases an A+ may be awarded. Absences may reduce the final grade, independent of these percentages. Note also that the SU course catalog indicates that in order to receive a C­-, "All required work is expected to be completed for this grade." For this course, this means that, at a minimum, two-thirds of all homeworks (excluding HW1) are submitted no more than a week late and with an average grade of at least 60% before any late penalties are applied, an Ignite Talk is given, and the project is turned in with a grade of at least 60% (note that these are necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, conditions for earning a C­-). For those taking the course on a P/D/F basis, earning at least a C­- corresponds to a P. Failure to meet these requirements means it is impossible to earn a grade higher than a D.

You are expected to keep an electronic copy of any electronic submission until you receive a grade. Failure to reply to email queries in a timely manner (as specified in the email) regarding assignments incorrectly or incompletely submitted (e.g. wrong file attached) will result in no credit given for the associated assignments, or late penalties being assigned. Any concerns regarding grading of an assignment must be brought to my attention within a week of when the item is returned to the class or feedback/grades are posted on Moodle.




## Classroom/Lab Policy

Cell phones are not to be used during class. Please set them to Do Not Disturb, not simply to vibrate. I strongly advise placing them in a bag rather than keeping them in a pocket or on your desk to avoid temptation. Should your phone ring, it will be confiscated for the remainder of the meeting in the front of the room. It is expected that when in class you will use the computers for course activities (note­-taking, writing code), not for web­-surfing, gaming, messaging, using Facebook, printing material for other courses, etc. You must obtain my explicit written permission to record any audio or video in the classroom.

Food, drinks (except in lidded containers), and tobacco products of any kind (including e-cigarettes) are prohibited. Please be courteous to those around you.


## Accommodations

Southwestern University will make reasonable accommodations for persons with documented disabilities. You should contact the Center for Academic Success and Records to determine your eligibility to receive accommodations (Prothro Center for Lifelong Learning; 512­-863­-1286). Please notify me as early as possible about any required accommodations.

## Calendar and Syllabus Updates

I will maintain a detailed calendar on Moodle, and you should refer to it regularly throughout the semester. I will try to adhere to the schedule as closely as possible, but all dates and details are subject to change.


## Acknowledgements

Ideas in this syllabus builds on everyone who has taught similar courses at other institutions, especially Alex Godwin and John Stasko at Georgia Tech.
