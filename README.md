## Course Material



## Learning Objectives

At the conclusion of this course, you will be expected to be able to:


## Textbook

One textbook is required for this course:

> Visualization Analysis & Design by Tamara Munzner

There will be additional articles, resources, and videos available through Moodle.







## Honor Code

By signing/typing the Honor Pledge, you assert that you have followed the applicable collaboration policies, understand all material (code and/or text) submitted, and __are capable of recreating it without assistance__  (even if the lab allowed you to get help from other students). The point of group assignments is for you to learn from each other, NOT for you to split up the work to do in isolation... work together. For some assignments, you will be allowed to use the internet to search for helpful information (the assignment will specify what you can search for). Whenever you do this, __you MUST provide the URLs of every site referenced, with an explanation of how the site helped you__. Failure to do so is a violation of the Honor Code.

In general, unless otherwise specified, it is a violation of the Honor Code to obtain code from others (at SU or otherwise).
<!-- , or to consult materials from previous offerings of this course. -->
You are never allowed, for any assignment, to get help from other students outside of this class. For all assignments, you must have written or typed the submission, and you must personally understand each submission well enough that you could recreate it on your own.
<!-- If a student is repeating the course, it is expected that he/she recreate solutions to all graded assignments from scratch. -->



## Exams

There is one midterm exam (tentatively scheduled for Tuesday October 17) and a final exam (Friday December 15 from 1:30pm-4:30pm as assigned by the registrar), all pledged. Make­-up exams may be oral, and will be given only for appropriately documented reasons of illness, family emergency, religious obligation, or participation in a university­-sponsored event. If you know you will be absent for a valid reason on an exam date, you must inform me as soon as possible so that we can arrange an alternate time for you to take the exam, preferably in advance of the rest of the class.





## Attendance

Class attendance is expected and required. You are responsible for making up all missed in-class material. I encourage you to acquire contact information from your classmates as soon as possible. Missing more than ten percent of a given class (arriving late, leaving early, sleeping, or otherwise inattentive in class) may be considered an absence.


For __each__ absence, you are expected to do the following:
1. Send me an email at least 1 hour before the start of class stating that you will be absent for that particular class. You do not need to tell me why; you simply need to inform me in advance. However, if you believe the absence is excused under university policy, you must also provide me with sufficient information to determine that. Even if you mention a future absence to me in person, you must still send me an email with details about your absence.
1. Show me a copy of your notes from the missed day at the start of the next class.
1. Complete the activities for the missed day by the next class period or a pre-arranged date for excused absences.

Provided you successfully complete #1, #2, and #3 the absence will have no direct impact on your grade. Completing only #1, but not #2 or #3, will result in a zero for that day's activity grade but no further penalty. Failing to complete #1 will result in one percentage point being deducted for the absence from your final grade.


Note that this policy applies to all absences, even those deemed excused under university policy (e.g. university­-sponsored activities, absences due to religious and cultural traditions). The Excused Absence Policy requires students to notify the professor as far in advance as possible, and to complete missed work. Though university policy does not consider illness to be an excused absence, I encourage you to use your best judgment in such situations, particularly if you may be contagious. Extenuating circumstances that prevent you from contacting me in advance will be handled on a case­-by-­case basis.

If you have five or more unexcused absences (whether or not you have followed the procedures above), you may be involuntarily withdrawn from the course.





## Grading

Your final grade will be computed as follows.

Component |	Weight
---------|---------
Engaged Participation	|  5%
Homeworks |	25%
Project | 30%
Midterm and Final Exams	| 40%


The grade cutoffs are listed here.

Grade | Min. Score
------|----------
A | 93%
A- |	90%
B+ |	87%
B	| 83%
B- |	80%
C+ |	77%
C	| 73%
C- |	70%
D	| 65%
D-	| 60%

They may be modified slightly at the instructor’s discretion, but only in your favor. In truly exceptional cases an A+ may be awarded. Absences may reduce the final grade, independent of these percentages. Note also that the SU course catalog indicates that in order to receive a C­-, "All required work is expected to be completed for this grade." For this course, this means that, at a minimum, the paper must be submitted no more than a week late and with an average grade of at least 60% before any late penalties are applied and at least two­-thirds of the deliverable labs are submitted by their respective deadlines (note that these are necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, conditions for earning a C­-). For those taking the course on a P/D/F basis, earning at least a C­- corresponds to a P. Failure to meet these requirements means it is impossible to earn a grade higher than a D.

You are expected to keep an electronic copy of any electronic submission until you receive a grade. Failure to reply to email queries in a timely manner (as specified in the email) regarding assignments incorrectly or incompletely submitted (e.g. wrong file attached) will result in no credit given for the associated assignments, or late penalties being assigned. Any concerns regarding grading of an assignment must be brought to my attention within a week of when the item is returned to the class or feedback/grades are posted on Moodle.




## Classroom/Lab Policy

Cell phones are not to be used during class. Please set them to Do Not Disturb, not simply to vibrate. I strongly advise placing them in a bag rather than keeping them in a pocket or on your desk to avoid temptation. Should your phone ring, it will be confiscated for the remainder of the meeting in the front of the room. It is expected that when in class you will use the computers for course activities (note­-taking, writing code), not for web­-surfing, gaming, messaging, using Facebook, printing material for other courses, etc. You must obtain my explicit written permission to record any audio or video in the classroom.

Food, drinks (except in lidded containers), and tobacco products of any kind (including e-cigarettes) are prohibited. Please be courteous to those around you.


## Accommodations

Southwestern University will make reasonable accommodations for persons with documented disabilities. You should contact the Center for Academic Success and Records to determine your eligibility to receive accommodations (Prothro Center for Lifelong Learning; 512­-863­-1286). Please notify me as early as possible about any required accommodations.

## Calendar and Syllabus Updates

I will maintain a detailed calendar on Moodle, and you should refer to it regularly throughout the semester. I will try to adhere to the schedule as closely as possible, but all dates and details are subject to change.


## Acknowledgements

Ideas in this syllabus builds on everyone who has taught this course before (though obviously not at SU) especially Alex Godwin and John Stasko at Georgia Tech.
